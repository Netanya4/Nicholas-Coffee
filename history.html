        <h2>The History of Coffee</h2>
        <p>
          The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in
          modern day Ethiopia, however neither where coffee was first cultivated
          nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have
          been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to
          concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and
          Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether
          it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the
          second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade
          routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the
          Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East
          Indies. <br />
